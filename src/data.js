      "Having worked with Ruella on 2 projects directly during our time at AND Digital, I am impressed by Ruella's passion and excellent skills. She is keen to take on tasks by herself and will proactively reach out to other teammates when she runs into issues or has questions. This has provided transparency to the whole team, as well as fostered the team culture of pair working and reaching out. Ruella is also an enthusiastic learner who will equip herself with new skills via LinkedIn Learning and other resources. Recently, she was certified as Professional Scrum Master by Scrum.org, which is a great addition on top of her practical experience working in Agile and Scrum team setup. Ruella is a quick learner and self starter who, I can imagine, will excel in any work place and bring innovation to the business",

      "I've worked with Ruella as her Scrum Master and coach and was absolutely delighted to see her learn and grow rapidly in a highly complex and not necessarily junior-friendly environment. She's done incredibly well with finding her feet in a completely new industry and learning about the business, the technology and testing in place as well as Agile methods like Scrum. Ruella is a curious and resourceful learner and within a short time she managed to pick up work independently. She has a great can-do attitude and didn't hesitate to volunteer for public speaking opportunities to teach young people about tech, nor was she afraid about presenting her work to stakeholders. I believe she has a bright future ahead of her and I would love to work with her again.",
